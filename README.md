Tinychat Desktop Application 

Tinychat Enchancement Suite included by default


Requires nativefier, install with npm

`sudo npm install -g nativefier`

Use a prebuilt .zip or compile your own with make, if you do not want the extentions use make vanilla.


I am in the process of rewriting and fixing the TES userscript to not rely on anything like tampermonkey for its functionality. I will write some more themes (omg pink) and various other fixes and changes. Most of the credit goes to the author of that original script.


Cool stuff:

* Dark theme (needs some work, gray theme not working yet but black theme works)

* Fixed the broken chat box (I think? testing as of this release)

* Expand videos to larger than usual

* Expand text box

* Hide user list

* Chat box autoscrolls

* Notifications? I think? probably not working yet

* Hide the info bar at the top

* Some other stuff
